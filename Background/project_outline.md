# Effects of salt pollution on survival and thermal limits of freshwater copepods 

## Background information 
Lake Champlain is a large, temperate lake. During winter, several species of calanoid copepods are abundant, with the community dominated by *Leptodiaptomus sicilis*. 

## Experimental Components 
1.  Generating survival curves at different concentrations of commonly available salts.
2.  Testing how exposure to increased salt concentrations affect upper thermal limits (CTmax).

## Experiment Outline

### Day 0
Copepods will be collected from the Burlington Fishing Pier using a 250 um mesh plankton net and returned to the lab, where they will be maintained at the temperature they were collected at in a small bench top incubator. 

Copepods will be picked from the contents of the tow using a large transfer pipette, and set up in groups of 10 in large petri dishes (n = 16). 

### Day 1 
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

After survival is checked, copepods are transferred to new media. Control dishes (n = 4) remain in the 'no salt' treatment, but all other dishes are filled with the next lowest salinity media. 

### Day 2
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

After survival is checked, copepods are transferred to new media. Control dishes remain in the 'no salt' treatment. Several dishes (n = 4) remain at the low salinity treatment. The rest are moved up to the intermediate salinity treatment. 

### Day 3
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

After survival is checked, copepods are transferred to new media. Control and low salinity dishes remain at their respective salt level. Several dishes (n = 4) also remain at the intermediate salinity treatment. The rest (n = 4) are moved up to the high salinity treatment. At this point, there should be four petri dishes at each concentration. 

### Day 4
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

### Day 5
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

### Day 6
Survival is checked in each dish and recorded. 

CTmax is measured for individuals from the control treatment and one of the salt treatments. Which salt treatment is used will depend on the number of individuals remaining at the end of the experiment. 

### Results summary
Each experimental replicate will produce daily survival estimates for each replicate dish and 20 thermal limit values. 

For four salt varieties, four weeks would be required.
